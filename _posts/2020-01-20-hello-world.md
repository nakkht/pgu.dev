title: "Hello, World!"

For quite some time I had an idea floating around my head about starting to write some sort of tech related blog and what not.
I guess it is time. Consider this a "Hello, World!".
<br>

The intention is to write anything related to Android (Java/Kotlin), iOS (Swift) and perhaps soon - Rust. 
Honestly, anything that I might find interesting in the tech world.
Meanwhile, random everyday thoughts will appear on <a href="https://twitter.com/nakkht">Twitter</a>.
